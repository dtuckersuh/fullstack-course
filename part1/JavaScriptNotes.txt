- Popular mode of transpiling (transform one language to another similar one) is using Babel

- In React code, it is preferable to use the method concat, which does not add the item to the array, but creates a new array in which the content
    of the old array and the new item are both included
    * const t = [1, -1. 3]
        const t2 = t.concat(5)

- map method
    * Map creates a new array, for which the function given as a parameter is used to create the items
const t = [1, 2, 3]
const m1 = t.map(value => value * 2)
console.log(m1) // [2, 4, 6] is printed

Object methods and "this"
    - In JS, the value of "this" is defined based on how the method is called
    - When method is called through a reference, the value of this becomes the global object
    - bind() can preserve original "this"
        * setTimeout(arto.greet.bind(arto), 1000)

Classes
    - Features in JS make simulating object-oriented classes possible
