What's the difference between an experienced JS programmer and a rookie? The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more.

Concatenate with ','
    - console.log('props value is', props)

map()
    - creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array
    - const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2)
        * [1, 4, 9, 16] => [2, 8, 18, 32]

Key-attribute
    - List items, i.e. elements generated by map method, must each have a unique key value
    - React uses key attribute to determine how to update view generated by component when component is re-rendered
    - Add a key to each child as well as each element inside children
        * There will be minimal DOM change for React to handle
Anti-pattern: array indexes as keys
    - Instead, each key should have a permanent and unique property assigned when item is created

Refactoring modules
    - In smaller applications, components are usually placed in components directory, which is placed within the src directory
